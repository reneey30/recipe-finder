# recipe-finder

Getting a good recipe online takes time especially making a decision on what to prepare when one is in a hurry. Having a way to get recipes based on ingredients come in handy in such a situation.

This project will create a website that lists three choices of recipes based on ingredients the user provided. 
This website will do so with the least amount of clicks and lesser time than searching for a recipe online. The website can also filter the recipes it provides based on parameters like calories, allergies,balanced diet among others.

This website will essentially be an SPA that will take in a text input of ingredients the user has, and displays three recipes that contain the ingredient. It will use an API that takes in ingredient names and returns recipes. The API to be used is Spoonacular (https://api.spoonacluar.com)
